	* simple-wiki-completion.el (swc-pages-completion): Make this
	variable global, else M-x pcomplete had somehow, stopped working.
	This way, something is better than nothing..  This way, of course,
	is still problematic when using the same emacs to edit multiple
	wikis at the same time, but that facility is already lost because
	of other problems as well.

	* simple-wiki-definitions.el (swd-wiki-defs-list): Restore
	swd-additional-headers (useful for passwords, etc.)
