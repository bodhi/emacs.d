;;; Change Log:

;;  1.0.7
;;   - Added call to `http-decode-buffer' to the http-get sentinel as the
;;     http-filter inserts the string now as binary.
;;  1.0.6
;;    - `simple-wiki-edit-mode' when saving a usemod wiki is now called
;;      in a http-post process sentinel
;;    - Added "Connection: close" header for HTTP/1.1 connections.
;;    - Reload pages after saving.
;;  1.0.5
;;    - Fixed infinite loop bug in swd-nick

;;; Code:

(require 'simple-wiki-edit)


(defvar swd-nick "bodhi")

;;; This below would be ideal, permitting additional-headers
;;; consistency while the user edits multiple wikis at the same time.
